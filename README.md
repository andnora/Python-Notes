# Python-Notes
 
#### Discription
Beginning 2022 I started learning Python. 
These are the notes I've made following the highly recommended Complete Python: Zero to Mastery Course of Andrei Neaggoie and Daniel Bourke. All the credits go out to them.

This repository contains notes about subjects in Data Analytics and Machine Learning. Together with some excercises from the course.
The reason for this repository is to show my knowledge in these subjects, in case anyone is wondering what my capabilities are.
